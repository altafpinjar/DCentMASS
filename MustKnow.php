  <h1>Interview Skills</h1>
  <h4>1) Practice good nonverbal communication</h4>
<p>It's about demonstrating confidence: standing straight, making eye contact and connecting with a firm handshake. That first nonverbal impression can be a great beginning—or quick ending—to your interview.
</p>
<h4>2) Dress for the job or company</h4>
<p>Today's casual dress codes do not give you permission to dress as "they" do when you interview. It is important to know what to wear to an interview and to be well-groomed. Whether you wear a suit or something less formal depends on the company culture and the position you are seeking. If possible, call to find out about the company dress code before the interview.
</p>
<h4>3) Listen</h4>
<p>From the very beginning of the interview, your interviewer is giving you information, either directly or indirectly. If you are not hearing it, you are missing a major opportunity. Good communication skills include listening and letting the person know you heard what was said. Observe your interviewer, and match that style and pace.
</p>
<h4>4) Don't talk too much</h4>
<p>Telling the interviewer more than he needs to know could be a fatal mistake. When you have not prepared ahead of time, you may ramble when answering interview questions, sometimes talking yourself right out of the job. Prepare for the interview by reading through the job posting, matching your skills with the position's requirements and relating only that information.
</p>
<h4>5) Don't be too familiar</h4>
<p>The interview is a professional meeting to talk business. This is not about making a new friend. Your level of familiarity should mimic the interviewer's demeanor. It is important to bring energy and enthusiasm to the interview and to ask questions, but do not overstep your place as a candidate looking for a job.
</p>
<h4>6) Use appropriate language</h4>
<p>It's a given that you should use professional language during the interview. Be aware of any inappropriate slang words or references to age, race, religion, politics or sexual orientation—these topics could send you out the door very quickly.
</p>
<h4>7) Don't be cocky</h4>
<p>Attitude plays a key role in your interview success. There is a fine balance between confidence, professionalism and modesty. Even if you're putting on a performance to demonstrate your ability, overconfidence is as bad, if not worse, as being too reserved.
</p>
<h4>8) Take care to answer the questions</h4>
<p>When interviewers ask for an example of a time when you did something, they are asking behavioral interview questions, which are designed to elicit a sample of your past behavior. If you fail to relate a specific example, you not only don't answer the question, but you also miss an opportunity to prove your ability and talk about your skills.
</p>
<h4>9) Ask questions</h4>
<p>When asked if they have any questions, most candidates answer, "No." Wrong answer. Part of knowing how to interview is being ready to ask questions that demonstrate an interest in what goes on in the company. Asking questions also gives you the opportunity to find out if this is the right place for you. The best questions come from listening to what you're asked during the interview and asking for additional information.
</p>
<h4>10) Don't appear desperate</h4>
<p>When you interview with the "please, please hire me" approach, you appear desperate and less confident. Reflect the three Cs during the interview: cool, calm and confidence. You know you can do the job; make sure the interviewer believes you can, too.

<div id="nad-section2" class="container-fluid">
  <h1>Aptitude</h1>
<p>1. Your competitors will be fully prepared so you must be too. Don’t fool yourself and think you don’t need to practice as many questions as possible.
</p>
<p>2. Maintain a positive mental attitude, think of your aptitude test as an opportunity to demonstrate your ability and outcompete other applicants, not as an onerous mandatory task.
</p>
<p>3. Focus on the areas you find hardest, focus the majority of your time on these questions.
</p>
<p>4. Be committed – get practicing as soon as possible and make time for practice, get started now.
</p>
<p>5. Keep practicing, once you’ve practiced as many tests as possible maintain your skills through question practice right up until the day before your assessment.
</p>
<p>6. Contact the company you’re applying to and find out what sort of format your tests you’ll be expected to sit and what format they will be in. Employers are increasingly testing candidates using computers so it’s most important to practice questions in this format.
</p>
<p>7. Practice under timed conditions and in exam conditions. This will improve your speed and confidence as well as performance on the day of your examination.
</p>
<p>8. Stick to your timings, if you get stuck move on. Further to this don’t simply guess, the more practice you undertake the easier you’ll find it to make educated guesses by ruling out unlikely answers – this will come with practice though.
</p>
<p>9. Embrace any anxiety you feel on the day of the examination, while adrenaline and nervousness can be distracting if you’ve prepared sufficiently you can calmly reflect on your practice and be confident you can beat the competition.
</p>
<p>10. Follow the formulas below to ace your numerical reasoning test</p>
<h4>Practice reasoning test questions</h4>
<p>
To improve your problem solving skills it is essential that you practice answering the types of questions that are likely to appear in your official numeracy test. When you go through your practice materials do not guess the answer but rather think about the solution and try to arrive at the correct answer yourself. At first, study the challenge that you are struggling with slowly. Make sure that you understand the logic and important concepts to work out the problem. Once you gain understanding of such challenge practice the concept on similar sets of questions and see whether you can work them out swiftly.
Remember, if you do not fully understand the logic behind the challenge and you don’t make enough effort to go properly over the explanation then you are likely to fail in further tests. Checking up on your understanding of each of the question and getting the point behind it improves your numerical aptitude skills.
</p>
<h4>Practice multiple-step solutions</h4>
<p>In order to advance your aptitude further you need to have regular exposure to the types of questions that cannot by merely solved by applying single routine arithmetic operations to one step problems; but rather you need to be confronted with set of challenges that require you to tackle multiple-step solutions where you have to get through various stages of calculations or mental computations to get to the final answer. You can see numerical problem solving section where you can find good example of such questions. Hence, to advance your problem solving competence for numerical reasoning you have to be faced with challenging tasks of various difficulty levels.
</p>
 <h4>Improve in your weak areas</h4>
<p>
To get ahead in your preparation you need to analyse any weaknesses in your knowledge of maths, mental arithmetic and problem solving. Any deficiencies in any of these areas may significantly impact on your ability to solve the questions and ultimately will lower your score. For example, if you have gaps in knowledge of sums and you have good mental or reasoning intellect then you are likely to fail because numbers cannot be manipulated except the rules of maths. Contrary, if you have good knowledge of arithmetic, that is, you know how to use percentages, fractions or other related arithmetic operations whereas your mental or reasoning abilities are not developed to the level that is required for numerical aptitude test, then your score is not likely to be high
Therefore, to improve your performance you need to acquire, develop or strengthen math, mental arithmetic and problem solving skills and work through types of exam papers that may come up in your official numerical aptitude exercise

  <h1>Soft Skills</h1>
  <p>Whereas hard skills are the tangible and technical skills easily demonstrated by a candidate’s qualifications and specific professional experiences, soft skills is a term used by employers to refer to the more intangible and non-technical abilities that are sought from candidates.
  </p>
  <p>Soft skills are sometimes referred to as transferable skills or professional skills. As this term implies, these are skills that are less specialised, less rooted in specific vocations, and more aligned with the general disposition and personality of a candidate. Examples of important soft skills are communication, teamwork and problem solving.
  </p>
  <h4>Communication</h4>
<p>As a soft skill, communication is not about multiple syllables or rousing speeches. Able communicators can adjust their tone and style according to their audience, comprehend and act efficiently on instructions, and explain complex issues to colleagues and clients alike. Communication is also an important aspect of leadership, since leaders must be able to delegate clearly and comprehensibly.
</p>
<h4>Self-Motivation</h4>
<p>Having the positive attitude and the initiative to work well without round-the-clock supervision is a vital soft skill for any employee. Not only does it demonstrate reliability and commitment, but it shows that you can fit efficiently into an organisational structure without the need for constant oversight.
</p>
<h4>Leadership</h4>
<p>Leadership is a soft skill you can show even if you’re not directly managing others. Leadership can be thought of as a collection of various other soft skills, such as a general positive attitude and outlook, the ability to communicate effectively, and an aptitude for both self-motivating and motivating others.
</p>
<h4>Responsibility</h4>
<p>Self-awareness is a seldom talked about but highly valued soft skill; knowing when to accept responsibility for any mistakes you have made demonstrates a healthy level of humility, and a willingness to learn and progress.
</p>
<h4>Teamwork</h4>
<p>Like leadership, good teamwork involves a combination of other soft skills. Working in a team towards a common goal requires the intuition and interpersonal acumen to know when to be a leader, and when to be a listener. Good team players are perceptive, as well as receptive to the needs and responsibilities of others.
</p>
<h4>Problem Solving</h4>
<p>Problem solving does not just require analytical, creative and critical skills, but a particular mindset: those who can approach a problem with a cool and level head will often reach a solution more efficiently than those who cannot. This is a soft skill which can often rely on strong teamwork too. Problems need not always be solved alone. The ability to know who can help you reach a solution, and how they can do it, can be a great advantage.
</p>
<h4>Decisiveness</h4>
<p>Knowing the distinction between decisiveness and recklessness implies a soft skill in itself. Decisiveness combines a number of different abilities: the ability to put things into perspective, to weigh up the options, to assess all relevant information and, crucially, to anticipate the consequences, good and bad.
</p>
<h4>Ability to Work Under Pressure and Time Management</h4>
<p>Many jobs come with demanding deadlines and occasionally high stakes. Recruiters prize candidates who show a decisive attitude, an unfaltering ability to think clearly, and a capacity to compartmentalise and set stress aside. Time management is closely related to the ability to work under pressure, as well as within tight deadlines. Employees who manage their time well are able to efficiently prioritise tasks and organise their diaries, while adopting an attitude which allows them to take on new tasks and deadlines.
</p>
<h4>Flexibility</h4>
<p>Naturally, people can be wary of leaving the comfort zone formed by their repertoire of hard skills. Flexibility is an important soft skill, inasmuch as it demonstrates an ability and willingness to acquire new hard skills, and an open-mindedness to new tasks and new challenges. Employers often seek candidates who can show a willing and upbeat attitude, since many jobs come with the possibility of secondments.
</p>
<h4>Negotiation and Conflict Resolution</h4>
<p>This is another of those soft skills which employers look for in potential leaders. To be an adept negotiator is to know how to be persuasive and exert influence, while sensitively seeking a solution which will benefit all parties. Similarly, conflict resolution depends on strong interpersonal skills and the ability to establish a rapport with colleagues and clients alike.
